Lab_ID:  represents a single tube of leeches (Lab_IDs with many leeches were subdivided for PCR. These get summed in the process of making the OTU table.)
region_English:  the whole park is divided into multiple large regions
Ranger_ID:  the ranger(s) who collected this sample. Multiple rows with the same Ranger_ID represent repeated samples (e.g. R127 has five rows).
Polygon_ID:  this is the polygon assigned to each ranger
leech_qty:  number of leeches per tube, which is an estimate of sampling effort
lysis_buffer:  the amount of lysis buffer total used to digest each tube of leeches
leech_volume:  the estimated volume of leeches
