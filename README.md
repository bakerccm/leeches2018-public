- This repo contains all code required to generate OTUs and analyze data for Ailaoshan leech iDNA project.

- Files (especially .Rmd files) may contain extra code not required for manuscript, including exploratory analyses and checks to ensure that analysis has been performed correctly. This extra code will likely be removed once the final form of the manuscript is known.

- Outputs are generally given the same filename as the code that generates them. (e.g. filename.Rmd produces filename.RData as an output). Many intermediate files and outputs are included in this repo (e.g. .RData files) for convenience. Others may be omitted especially where their size exceeds limits imposed by github. Any omitted files can be regenerated using code contained in the repo.
